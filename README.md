A package designed to aid in getting data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) API at
https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html.

### Overview

The `epair` package helps you determine what data you want and how to get that data from the EPA API.
It provides loaded in variables that help you navigate services in the API, and a simple way to query the data. A comprehensive tutorial for using `epair` can be found at https://glorozcom.github.io/epair/. 

Place the call using built-in service functions.

```
> result <- get_daily_summary_in_state(bdate = "20190101",
                                       edate = "20190131",
                                       param = "44201",         # Ozone
                                       state.fips = "02")       # Alaska
> alaska <- result$Data
```

Another approach giving the same results is manually placing the call by first finding the endpoint you need.
```
> services$`Daily Summary Data`$Filters$`By State`$Endpoint
[1] "dailyData/byState"
```

Then place the call by specifying the appropriate endpoint.

```
> endpoint <- "dailyData/byState"
> vars <-  list(bdate = "20190101",
                edate = "20190131",
                param = "44201",    # Ozone
                state = "02")       # Alaska
> result <- perform.call(endpoint, vars)
> alaska <- result$Data

### Installation

You can download the latest release from this repo using `devtools`. 

```
devtools::install.github("GLOrozcoM/epair")
```

Or, download these files and in your working directory run

```
devtools::install("GLOrozcoM/epair")
```

`epair` depends on `httr` for making its data calls and `rvest` for creating the variables loaded in with the package. We recommend having `httr` installed (automatically taken care of through package dependencies), and only installing `rvest` if you're curious about how package variables were made.

### Key features

Look at variables to glean more information on the kind of data call you want to make. 

* `services` provides an easy to use container for all services and required calling variables
for the API. 
* `variables` gives you information on all required calling variables. 
* `endpoints` offers a comprehensive list of every endpoint used in the API.

Place your call without having to worry about string manipulations or JSON files.

* corresponding `get` functions will take the required variables and will automatically use the correct endpoint, providing the user with the result as a dataframe.
* `perform.call()` will take an endpoint and variables and provided the user with metadata and desired data as a dataframe. 
* `perform.call.raw()` will give the same results as `perform.call()` except for in JSON format.

Caching is automatically supported through internal use of `R.cache`. 

## Usage notes

Note that currently a single call to AQS allows for at maximum a single year's worth of data. You'll need to create separate calls to get multiple year's worth of data.

### ropenaq

You may want to check out `ropenaq` instead depending on the goals behind your study. `ropenaq` is an R wrapper for accessing the OpenAQ API - see its website [here](https://docs.ropensci.org/ropenaq/). Here are a few differences:

* `epair` will get data from a single source (EPA AQS API), while `ropenaq` will be more useful if you’re trying to compare data from different sources.

* If you're interested in data for the US only, `epair` would be an appropriate choice. For more locations across the world, `ropenaq` would work better. 

* `epair’s` data source does offer more granularity than OpenAQ for US data. The EPA AQS API can give over 500 parameters/pollutants of interest (as opposed to OpenAQ’s 5), county level coverage, and unaggregated raw data. By default, OpenAQ will give aggregated data so if you're only interested in aggregations, then OpenAQ is the way to go.
